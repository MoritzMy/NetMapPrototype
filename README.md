###NetMap

This is a small Side-Project for studying purposes

The Goal is to create a Graph Map of the current Network per Network Interface on the device.
This will be achieved and displayed seperately in two ways:

- Ping Sweep
- ARP Scan

The Ping Scan is based on a self-made implementation of an ICMP Echo Request and is therefore probably not optimal.
